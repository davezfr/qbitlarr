        """Main qBitlarr tool for normal users.

        Pass a raw user request such as "tt0045877",
        "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0045877/",
        "https://movie.douban.com/subject/1292052/",
        "https://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=25801.html",
        "The Hitch-Hiker", or "Example Show S03". Every request is resolved to a
        single movie/show identity first, then to ranked release choices, so the
        keyword path and the IMDb/Douban/AlloCine path end at the same place.

        Branch on the response "action":
          - "show_results": ranked release choices for one identified title.
            Present them and download the user's pick. Telegram adapters that
            support Bot API sendRichMessage should send "choice_rich_message"
            as rich_message, then render "choice_buttons" below it. Markdown or
            generic rich-text hosts can use "choice_display"; plain hosts can
            send "choices_table" verbatim inside a monospace block. For generic
            clarify/picker tools, pass each result's "label" field as the
            choices array. Stock Hermes-style clarify supports four choices and
            appends its own "Other" option, so qBitlarr defaults to four release
            choices. Custom adapters may use "choice_buttons" and "ui_hints" to
            render a closed inline row, for example five numeric Telegram
            buttons when QBITLARR_MANUAL_RESULT_LIMIT=5 and
            QBITLARR_CHOICE_STYLE=telegram-rich. Never re-format the table, and
            do not append "quality" to the label (it is already in the table).
          - "auto_download" (mode="auto" only): the best release was queued; an
            "alternatives" list of runner-ups is included so the user can be
            offered "or did you mean..." without a second call.
          - "confirm" (mode="confirm"): the top pick plus alternatives, nothing
            queued.
          - "choose_title": a keyword matched several titles. The "candidates"
            list holds {index, title, year, imdb_id, label}. Ask the user which
            one they mean (show each "label"), then call qbitlarr_handle again
            with the chosen candidate's imdb_id to get its release choices.
          - "needs_imdb": no title could be identified (an unresolved link or a
            keyword with no match). Relay the message and ask the user to send
            an IMDb link or ID.

        Args:
            user_message: IMDb ID, IMDb URL, supported Douban movie link,
                supported AlloCine film link, title, season phrase, or plain
                search terms. qBitlarr recommends 1080p by default. Include
                "4K", "2160p", "UHD", "720p", "480p", or "Remux" only when
                the user explicitly asks for that quality.
            user_id: Optional caller identifier for logs and multi-user context.
                When serving multiple people through one qBittorrent instance,
                pass a stable chat/user ID so future status checks can be scoped
                to that requester's tagged torrents.
            save_path: Optional qBittorrent save path override, such as
                "/media/Kids". Leave unset to use qBitlarr's configured defaults.
            mode: Optional output mode. "manual" (server default) returns a
                ranked list without downloading; "auto" picks and queues the
                best release immediately; "confirm" returns the top pick and
                alternatives without queueing. Leave unset to use the server
                default (QBITLARR_DEFAULT_MODE).
            notification_target: Optional Hermes send target, such as
                "telegram:123456789". When set and the response includes a
                torrent hash, qBitlarr will send that target a one-time
                completion notification when the torrent reaches 100%. When
                omitted, qBitlarr reuses user_id if it already looks like a
                Hermes send target.
            completion_followup_message: Optional one-line user-facing message
                appended to the completion notification, such as "Download
                complete. Starting subtitle processing." Use this only when a
                downstream workflow was already requested.
